## üîê Security Checklist

### Wallet Security
- [ ] Use hardware wallet for mainnet deployments
- [ ] Never commit private keys to version control
- [ ] Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- [ ] Enable 2FA on all accounts
- [ ] Verify wallet addresses multiple times before deployment

### Smart Contract Security
- [ ] All contracts compiled and tested
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Multi-signature wallets configured for admin functions
- [ ] Emergency pause mechanisms tested

### API Security
- [ ] All API keys properly secured
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced everywhere
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers set

## üì± Smart Contract Deployment

### 1. Compile Contracts
```bash
npm run contracts:compile
```

### 2. Run Comprehensive Tests
```bash
npm run test
npm run test:coverage
```

### 3. Deploy to Sepolia Testnet
```bash
# Ensure you have Sepolia ETH for gas fees
npm run contracts:deploy:sepolia
```

### 4. Verify Contracts on Etherscan
```bash
npm run contracts:verify
```

### 5. Deploy to Mainnet (Production)
```bash
# CRITICAL: Double-check all environment variables
npm run contracts:deploy
```

## üåê Frontend Deployment

### 1. Build Next.js Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy to Firebase Hosting
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy to staging
firebase hosting:channel:deploy staging

# Deploy to production
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## ü§ñ Automation Systems

### 1. Trading Automation
```bash
# Start trading automation system
npm run automation:start

# Monitor automation logs
npm run automation:logs
```

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
- Runs security audits
- Executes all tests
- Deploys to staging on `develop` branch
- Deploys to production on `main` branch
- Verifies smart contracts
- Performs health checks

## üìä Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Smart Contract Verification
```bash
# Verify contract functionality
npm run contracts:health-check

# Check contract balances and state
npm run contracts:status
```

### 2. Frontend Health Check
```bash
# Check frontend deployment
curl -f https://your-domain.com/api/health

# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance
```

### 3. Database Configuration
```bash
# Deploy Firestore rules and indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes
```

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Contract Pause
```bash
# Pause all contract operations
npm run contracts:emergency-pause

# Unpause when safe
npm run contracts:emergency-unpause
```

### Rollback Deployment
```bash
# Rollback Firebase hosting
firebase hosting:clone source-site-id:source-channel-id target-site-id:live

# Rollback to previous contract version (if needed)
npm run contracts:rollback
```

## üìà Monitoring & Alerts

### Google Cloud Monitoring
- Application performance monitoring enabled
- Error rate alerts configured
- Response time monitoring active
- Custom dashboards for smart contract metrics

### Firebase Analytics
- User engagement tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Crash reporting
- Real-time database monitoring

## üîÑ Maintenance & Updates

### Regular Tasks
1. **Weekly**: Review audit logs and security alerts
2. **Monthly**: Update dependencies and security patches
3. **Quarterly**: Comprehensive security audit
4. **As needed**: Smart contract upgrades (using proxy patterns)

### Update Deployment
```bash
# For smart contract updates
npm run contracts:upgrade

# For frontend updates
git push origin main  # Triggers automatic deployment
```

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Contract Deployment Fails
- Check gas price and limit settings
- Verify wallet has sufficient ETH balance
- Ensure private key is correctly formatted
- Check network connectivity

#### Frontend Build Fails
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run typecheck`
- Verify environment variables are set

#### Firebase Deployment Issues
